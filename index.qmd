I am a **Mechnical Engineer** and **GIS Expert** specializing in **energy systems, resource efficiency, and district heating**. With **more than a decade** of applied research, consulting, and hands-on **HVAC** engineering experience. I work on the techno-economic assessment of renewable heat supply technologies and contribute to municipal heat planning across Germany and Europe.

I have completed my **PhD at Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg** with the focus on **modelling and integration of renewable heating solutions into existing district energy networks**. I am particularly passionate about applying **GIS** spatial data analysis to energy system research, as it allows me to visualize spatial dynamics and uncover insights that are critical for sustainable urban and regional planning. I continue to enjoy visiting construction sites to stay closely connected to the practical implementation of energy and HVAC solutions.
